# Task ID: 6
# Title: Setup CLI Entry Point with Commander
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the main CLI entry point using the 'commander' library. Define the commands `add`, `list`, and `done` with their expected arguments and options.
# Details:
Create an `index.ts` file. Import `Command` from `commander`. Set up the main program and define three commands: `program.command('add <description>')`, `program.command('list')`, and `program.command('done <id>')`. Parse the process arguments at the end of the file.

# Test Strategy:
Run the compiled script with `--help` to ensure all commands are listed correctly. Run each command with dummy arguments (e.g., `todo add 'test'`) and verify that the parser recognizes them without crashing.

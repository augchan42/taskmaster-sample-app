# Task ID: 10
# Title: Error Handling and UX Refinement
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement comprehensive error handling for user inputs and file operations, and refine the overall user experience with clearer output messages.
# Details:
Wrap file operations in `try...catch` blocks to handle potential file corruption or permission errors. Add validation for the `done` command to ensure the ID is a valid number. Add user-friendly messages, e.g., 'Task added successfully.', 'Task #1 marked as done.', 'Error: Task with ID 5 not found.'.

# Test Strategy:
Test edge cases: try to complete a non-existent task ID. Try to run `done` with a non-numeric argument. Attempt to read a malformed `tasks.json` file. Verify that the application handles these cases gracefully and provides clear, informative error messages to the user without crashing.

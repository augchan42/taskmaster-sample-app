# Task ID: 7
# Title: Integrate 'add' Command with CLI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Connect the 'add' command logic to the CLI entry point. When a user runs `todo add "..."`, the `addTask` function should be called with the description.
# Details:
In `index.ts`, for the `add` command definition, add an `.action()` handler. This handler will receive the `description` string from the command-line arguments and will call the `addTask(description)` function.

# Test Strategy:
Perform an end-to-end test. Clear the `tasks.json` file. Run the command `node dist/index.js add "My first task"`. Manually inspect or use the `list` command to verify that the task was added correctly to the `tasks.json` file.

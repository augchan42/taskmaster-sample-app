# Task ID: 8
# Title: Integrate 'list' Command with CLI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Connect the 'list' command logic to the CLI entry point. When a user runs `todo list`, the `listTasks` function should be executed.
# Details:
In `index.ts`, for the `list` command definition, add an `.action()` handler that calls the `listTasks()` function.

# Test Strategy:
Perform an end-to-end test. Manually create a `tasks.json` file with a few sample tasks. Run the command `node dist/index.js list` and verify that the console output correctly displays the tasks from the file.

# Task ID: 9
# Title: Integrate 'done' Command with CLI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Connect the 'done' command logic to the CLI entry point. When a user runs `todo done <id>`, the `completeTask` function should be called with the ID.
# Details:
In `index.ts`, for the `done` command definition, add an `.action()` handler. This handler will receive the `id` string, which should be parsed into a number (`parseInt`) before being passed to the `completeTask(id)` function.

# Test Strategy:
Perform an end-to-end test. Add a task using the `add` command. Run `node dist/index.js done 1`. Use the `list` command to verify that the task's status has been updated to 'done' in the `tasks.json` file.

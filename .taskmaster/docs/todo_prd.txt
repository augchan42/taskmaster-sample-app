# Overview
This document describes a simple command-line (CLI) To-Do list application. The application will allow users to add, view, and mark tasks as complete. It solves the problem of keeping track of daily tasks in a simple, fast, and local way.

# Core Features
- **Add a task:** Users can add a new task to their to-do list with a description.
- **List all tasks:** Users can view all their tasks, showing their ID, description, and status (pending/done).
- **Mark task as complete:** Users can mark a task as completed using its ID.
- **Persistence:** Tasks should be saved to a local file (e.g., `tasks.json`) so they are not lost when the application closes.

# User Experience
The application will be used from the command line.
- User flow for adding a task: `todo add "Buy milk"`
- User flow for listing tasks: `todo list`
- User flow for completing a task: `todo done 1`

# Technical Architecture
- **Language:** Node.js with TypeScript.
- **Framework:** None, it's a simple CLI tool. We can use a library like `yargs` or `commander` for argument parsing.
- **Data Storage:** A single JSON file (`.todo/tasks.json`) in the user's home directory to store the tasks.
- **Data Model:**
  - Task: `{ id: number, description: string, status: 'pending' | 'done' }`

# Development Roadmap
- **MVP:**
  - Implement the `add`, `list`, and `done` commands.
  - Basic JSON file storage.
- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Add a `remove` command.
  - Add due dates or priorities.
  - Prettier output formatting.

# Logical Dependency Chain
1.  Set up the basic project structure (package.json, tsconfig.json).
2.  Implement the data storage module to read/write from the JSON file.
3.  Implement the `add` command logic.
4.  Implement the `list` command logic.
5.  Implement the `done` command logic.
6.  Wire everything up in a main CLI entry point using an argument parser.

# Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk:** Concurrent writes to the JSON file could corrupt it.
- **Mitigation:** For this simple app, it's a low risk as it's a single-user CLI tool. We will read the file before each operation and write it back immediately. No complex file locking is needed for the MVP.
